## 🌥️🌤️🌞 Hi, thanks for stopping by! 🌈🍀 🪽

I'm Holly-Nsiya, a Data Scientist based in London.

Data Science + Creative Strategy is my sweet spot—here you'll find my journey through code.

I have a deep interest in understanding the “why” behind cultural moments in time,data is one of the few mediums that allows us to peel back the layers often hidden behind news timelines or buried under blog pages.

My current research project explores Black British Landmark Preservation.

## Tech stack & tools

⚡  Python, R-Studio, SQL & C++. 

⚡ Figma, Tableau, and Adobe Creative Suite (my strongest being Illustrator & After Effects).
