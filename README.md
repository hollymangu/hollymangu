## 🌥️🌤️🌞 Hi, thanks for stopping by! 🌈🍀 🪽

I'm Holly-Nsiya, a Data Scientist based in London.

Data Science + Creative Strategy is my sweet spot—here you'll find my journey through code.

⚡ With projects spanning from novel metrics to measure government policy frameworks, to archival analysis regarding Black British historical landmarks—all wrapped up in a pretty Plotly graph!

⚡ My main tech stack is Python, R-Studio, SQL & C++. My favorite tools are Figma, Tableau, and Adobe Creative Suite (my strongest being Illustrator & After Effects).

⚡ I have a deep interest in understanding the “why” behind cultural moments in time, and data is one of the few mediums that allows me to peel back the layers often hidden behind news timelines or buried under blog pages.

Currently, my favorite project I've worked on is Exploring Black British Landmark Preservation.
